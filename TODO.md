### Routes

-   search for an artist
-   subscribe to an artist (+ add it to the database first if needed)
-   unsubscribe to an artist

### Commands

-   fetching artist's infos (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/get_a_catalog_artist)
-   fetching method for an artist's new releases

    > if not possible with Apple Music API :

    -   fetch with iTunes API
    -   get releases data with Apple Music API

## Later

-   get user's artists in his library (firstly back : send music token then fetch / then front : fetch artists then display the list ?)
